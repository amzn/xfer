## unsupervised

Here, we copied the main src folder of https://github.com/fmu2/gradfeat20 (MIT License) and modified it.

To run the MAP results, run `python benchmark_rop.py --config=configs/....` while the vi ones are at
`python vi_benchmark_rop.py --config=configs/....` 

We moved the hard paths in the config file and replaced them with $LOC. 
You should change that after cloning their repo.
